# Air-and-Weather-Monitoring-System
___
## 1.0 About Project : 

- This project just needs a power supply through a simple micro type mobile charger and a Wi-Fi Connection.
- The system makes use of NodeMCU, MQ135 and DHT11 sensors. 
- It provides Smart City real time working of Air and Weather Monitoring System. 
- This project is connected to Blynk App through which user is notified about the change in Environment. 
- The project notifies as a notification and an E-Mail, if any change in air quality is observed. 
- This project is connected to ThingSpeak, where a real time graph of humidity and temperature is plot. 
- By using Matlab Visualization in ThingSpeak, one can perform online analysis and process data as it comes in. 
- ThingSpeak is often used for prototyping and proof-of-concept IoT systems that require analytics.
